  ‘Photography is the simultaneous

  recognition, in a fraction of a second, of the significance of an event as
  well

  as of a precise organisation of forms which give that event its proper

  expression.’

_'Photography is the simultaneous
recognition, in a fraction of a second, of the significance of an event as well
as of a precise organisation of forms which give that event its proper
expression.'_

Henri Cartier-Bresson

Photography was invented by some early nineteenth-century
artists but was in 1888 when George Eastman introduced the hand-held Kodak
camera, making photography easily done. "" its slogan rang. Photography impacted society being the world's
primary way of revealing itself to us. People started to capture everyday
motion and seeing that each of us was a node in a vast constellation. Before reality was available trough
artistic paintings. It was screened through old master's
eyes, techniques and humanity. Accurate brushstrokes gave away to physical points
or pixels from a photograph. This physical leap led to an increase in the
perception with which population got a close look at world, objects,
communities and cultures.

The 'decisive moment' was a
term coined by the pioneer of street photography, Henri Cartier-Bresson.According him, it is a unique split-second in which events in the world
-- interactions between people, movement, light and form -- combine in perfect
visual harmony. Once it passes, it is gone forever. The best photo opportunities often flash before our eyes and we must be ready permanently to
capture those moments. Cartier-Bresson summarizes the essential skills for
capturing the decisive moment in two: knowing and intuiting. First requires
conscious attention but the second not. Personally I found in the photography a
very interesting analogy to explain how Big Data and Internet of Things are the
catalyst for the Fourth Industrial Revolution and that actually is the
beginning of a revolution. Big Data and digitalization technologies are
revealing us the world as we've never seen before. The potential it offers is
the ability to abstract from large sets of information unveiling something that
we're not expecting. Best data insights often flash before our eyes as the
perfect photography. Digitalization represents a move to emphasize the value of
the information, rather than the object it's attached to. It's like bringing
the camera always with us, everywhere, capturing all instants around us to find
these meaningful unique-split moments. Big Data is also a move away from try
understanding why things really happen to learn see the world through the
association between observable phenomena. Analytic technologies enables an
entirely new approach for making sense of the world; rather than testing a
theory by analysing relevant data, new data analytics seek to gain insights directly
'born from the data'. 

_'A photograph is
neither taken or seized by force. It offers itself up. It is the photo that
takes you. One must not take photos'_

Henri Cartier-Bresson

Cartier defined himself as a street photograph. He was pioneer in what
we call photojournalism. His snapshots were a new and powerful way of
documenting the world. The most significant benefit of photojournalism was its
ability to push for social change by illustrating the problems in the society.
It was about capturing images to help telling stories. With Big Data
technologies hundreds of different algorithms can be applied to a dataset to
determine the best explanation. Instead of writing stories with the available
data these new technologies enable a new narrative from the emerging insights. It
creates a radical shift in how we think about a problem and mostly in how we
picture it.

**Industry 4.0**

Last Davos meeting' attendants did not appear to have
any doubts about the fact that Fourth Industrial Revolution is here to stay.
According some experts we are living an explosion of technological innovation
that nobody knows very well how to class. Hiroaki Nakanishi, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of Hitachi conducted an issue briefing under the heading 

.
He gave a personal definition about what was going on: Industry 4.0 is about
adjusting our business models to a more customer oriented ones. He was talking
about the opportunity we have to tell new substantial stories to our customers
and get them involved into too. This is the path in witch companies can offer
new services and get fringe benefits and therefore a threat to an irreversible
change in how companies make money. 

We could say that each traditional business line has a
potential digital counterpart. Industrial groups are tackling a future where an
estimated 30 billion devices will be Internet-connected by 2020 when IoT market
is expected to reach USD 151.01 Billion at a CAGR of 8.03% between 2015 and
2020\. Those components will produce exabytes of new data. The debate now is how
to make money from selling this data. It's about emphasizing the value of the
information and creating a visual narrative from a new data language coming
from these connections. Industrial digitalization wants to integrate different
industrial processes by creating new information flows trough them. The intent
is to connect for example, an industry supply chain management process with its
maintenance operations in order to improve manufacturing -- cut its costs and
raise the productivity of its products and services. Processes don't need to be
complicated anymore -- they should be distilled to open up new opportunities for
consumers without being overly complex, just smart.
